## COVID-19 SQL Analysis Project

This project analyzes COVID-19 data using SQL queries and visualizes the findings with a Power BI dashboard. Below is an overview of the SQL queries and the insights they provide.

### SQL Queries and Insights

1. **Total Deaths vs. Total Cases**:
   - Analyzes the likelihood of dying from COVID-19 in a specific country by comparing total deaths to total cases.

2. **Total Cases vs. Population**:
   - Shows the percentage of the population that got COVID-19 by comparing total cases to the population.

3. **Countries with the Highest Infection Rate**:
   - Identifies countries with the highest infection rate compared to their population.

4. **Continents with the Highest Death Count per Population**:
   - Highlights continents with the highest death count relative to their population.

5. **Global Statistics**:
   - Provides global statistics on new cases, new deaths, and the overall death percentage.

6. **Total Population vs. Vaccinations**:
   - Compares the total population to the number of vaccinations administered.

7. **Using Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
   - Uses CTEs to calculate cumulative vaccinations and the percentage of the population vaccinated.

8. **Temporary Table for Vaccination Data**:
   - Creates a temporary table to store and analyze vaccination data, including the percentage of the population vaccinated.

### Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI file included in this project visualizes the results of the SQL queries. It contains charts that help in understanding the spread and impact of COVID-19 globally and regionally. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the data, making it easier to derive insights.

### How to Use

1. **SQL Queries**:
   - The SQL queries can be run on a SQL Server database with the relevant COVID-19 data tables (`reports.Covid_Deaths$` and `reports.Covid_Vaccinations`).

2. **Power BI File**:
   - Open the Power BI file to view the visualizations. The file is designed to provide an interactive experience, allowing users to explore the data further.

### Conclusion

This project offers a detailed analysis of COVID-19 data using SQL and presents the findings in an easy-to-understand Power BI dashboard. It aims to provide valuable insights into the impact of the pandemic.
